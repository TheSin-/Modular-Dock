# Modular-Dock - WIP
Modular Dock for StealthChanger (TapChanger)

This dock is a slide in type. The back plate will allow for you to adjust the tool to be at perfect 90, I'd recommend 1 degree forward just to keep the dock in place.  Magnets are 2x5s and are optional, but recommened.

See [TODO](TODO.md)
